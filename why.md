## why

- we want everyone to be able to use IYO as identity provider for any existing http(s) resource
- we want them to do this without understanding much about jwt or iyo, just easy add groups & lets iyo do the rest
- needs to be a swiss army knife to let people securely explose their http(s) content
- allow them to see who looked how long at what content
